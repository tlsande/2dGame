Project description: Added shooting and sprite explosions.

The easiest part of this project: updating the base sprite to explode.

Problems that I had in completing this project: I haven't managed to get multisprites to explode.
Everytime I try to explode a multisprite my program crashes. I'm also currently unable to get
bullets to change direction with the player sprite. I also haven't got object pooling to work which
is making collision detectioin for bullets harder to do.
